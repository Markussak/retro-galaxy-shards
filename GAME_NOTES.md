# SPACE EXPLORER - 2D 16-BIT OPEN-WORLD SPACE GAME

## GAME VISION
A retro-styled 2D space exploration game featuring:
- 16-bit pixel art with extensive dithering and shadowing
- Dark, atmospheric color palette with CRT-heavy aesthetic
- Procedurally generated galaxy with realistic physics
- Two seamless game scenes: Star Systems and Interstellar Space
- Complex ship management and exploration mechanics

## VISUAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS
- **16-bit pixel art** with checkerboard dithering
- **Dark color palette**: Deep space blues/purples, muted grays, off-whites
- **CRT monitor effects**: Scan lines, chromatic aberration
- **Industrial/damaged UI**: Scratches, wear marks, mechanical elements
- **Retro typography**: Monospace pixel fonts

## CORE MECHANICS
- Physics-based ship movement with gravity and inertia
- Seamless transitions between star systems and interstellar space
- 30-frame rotating celestial body sprites
- Resource management (fuel, energy, ammunition, supplies)
- Advanced combat with AI alien encounters
- Research, trade, diplomacy, and crew management

## STATUS BAR INTERFACE (5 Panels)
1. **Ship Systems**: Hull, shields, fuel, energy indicators
2. **Ship Control**: Toggle buttons and thrust sliders
3. **Central Monitor**: Ship damage display and quick access
4. **Weapons**: Weapon selection and status
5. **Navigation**: Radar and galaxy map access

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES
1. Core visual foundation and design system
2. Basic ship movement and physics
3. Status bar implementation
4. Procedural generation framework
5. Combat and exploration mechanics
